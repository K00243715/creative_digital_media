    <h3>Phare du Petit Minou</h3>
    <h4>Plouzané, Bretagne</h4>
    <p>The <strong>Phare du Petit Minou</strong> is a lighthouse in the roadstead of Brest, standing in front of the <strong>Fort du Petit Minou</strong>, in the commune of Plouzané. By aligning it with the phare du Portzic, it shows the safe route to follow for ships to enter the roadstead.
    It also has a red signal that indicates a dangerous sector around the plateau of <strong>les Fillettes</strong> (meaning "the girls"), one of the submerged rocks in the goulet of Brest. Sailors remember this by using the mnemonic <strong>"the Minou blushes when he covers les Fillettes"</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Killough, Co Down</h4>
  <p>Its strikingly tall tower is marked with vibrant bands of yellow and black. These vivid colours, which distinguish it from other lighthouses, are known as its daymark. 
You can now live the life of a lightkeeper in this remote and beautiful spot. Enjoy very comfortable and characterful self-catering accommodation in either of the two lightkeepers’ cottages, Ketch and Sloop, managed by Irish Landmark Trust.</p>

  <h2>South Stack</h2>
</section>

<section id="section-C">
  <h4>Anglesey, Wales</h4>
  <p>The lighthouse has warned passing ships of the treacherous rock below since its completion in 1809. The 91-foot (28 m)-tall lighthouse on South Stack was designed by Daniel Alexander and the main light is visible to passing vessels for 24 nmi (44 km; 28 mi), and was designed to allow safe passage for ships on the treacherous Dublin–Holyhead–Liverpool sea route. It provides the first beacon along the northern coast of Anglesey for east-bound ships. It is followed by lighthouses, fog horns and other markers at North Stack, Holyhead Breakwater, The Skerries, the Mice, Point Lynas and at the south-east tip of the island Trwyn Du. The lighthouse is operated remotely by Trinity House.[3] It has been visited by the team at Most Haunted. </p>

  <h2>Tourlitis</h2>
</section>

<section id="section-D">
  <h4>Andros, Greece</h4>
  <p>The lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in Andros. The stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon. Unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world, and was destroyed during World War II. For a time, the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse, and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost.</p>
